<p>Thanks for checking my player out!<br>//Yazaar</p>
<p>Warning, this project may not be perfect. I did this to experiment with the YouTube API</p>
<br>
<h1>How to use the player:</h1>
<p>Find the search box, treat it like a youtube search bar<br>Click on the videos that you want to add</p>
<p>You may as well view a specific playlist, this can be done by searing with a playlist url, for example:<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYH8WvNV1YEn_iiBMZiZ2aWugQfN1qVfM</p>
<p>Requirements for playlist url:<br>1: contain "youtube.com/playlist?"<br>2: contain "list=[list-id]"</p>
<br><br>
<p>Click on a song in the queue to remove it, and click on the "REMOVE" button to change mode</p>
<br>
<h1>Now including overlay for OBS ++</h1>
<p>How to enable: Click "Toggle Overlay"</p>
<p>The overlay will pop up, it will follow wherever you scroll, customize it to your liking or use a preset (3 available) and capture it thru a window capture.</p>
<h1>Known "bugs":</h1>
<p>Shows the owner of the playlist and not the video as channel</p>
