        <h2 id="GettingStarted-Introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the YouTube Player documentation. You may find a lot of answears for your questions here.<br>
            Still problems? Feel free to contact me on discord (Yazaar#1779) or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/yazaar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitch</a>.</p>

        <h1 id="Videos">Videos</h1>
        <h2 id="Videos-VideoSearch">Video Search</h2>
        <p>Find the big search box and treat it like an official YouTube search box. Click search and wait for videos to
            appear.<br> Not working? Try to <a href="#GoogleAPI-SwapKey">swap API key</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="Videos-ViewPlaylist">View Playlist</h2>
        <p>Find your YouTube playlist URL which is public. Paste it into the big search box and click the "Search
            Playlist" button.<br><br>example URL: <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYH8WvNV1YEnblnazwa6y27kkeqg35dfz" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYH8WvNV1YEnblnazwa6y27kkeqg35dfz</a>
        </p>
        <h2 id="Videos-AddByURL">Add By URL</h2>
        <p>Find your YouTube video URL which is public. Paste it into the big search box and click the "Find Video"
            button.<br><br>example URL: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g7yAXPuu6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g7yAXPuu6A</a></p>

        <h1 id="GoogleAPI">Google API</h1>
        <h2 id="GoogleAPI-Information">Information</h2>
        <p>The search box is powered by the google API which means that a key is required. Each key has a limited amount
            of "points" which you as an user may use each day. This leads to problems if a large amount of people are
            using the website. The official key runs out of "points" or "quotas" as it is called. Use your private key
            to decrease your limitations.<br>Songrequests and searching for a specific video thru an URL works without
            the API key! But it will try to use the key for an extended amount of data.</p>
        <h2 id="GoogleAPI-SwapKey">Swap Key</h2>
        <p>First of all, open up the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">google console</a>. Click "Select a project" which can be found to the right
            of their Google logo. A window should pop up with the button "NEW PROJECT", click it. Feel free to swap the
            project name but this is not required. Skip location and click the blue "CREATE" button. You should see
            a loading animation around the notification icon top right, click the icon and wait until your project is
            created. When it is done click on the new project. Wait for the page to load and open up the navigation menu (found top left).
            Hover over "APIs & Services" and click on "Cridentials". Click on the blue button "Create credentials"
            and then on "API key". Copy your key which should pop up and click close (feel free to restrict your key
            but this is not required). Save the API key somewhere, nobody can use your key to gain personal information
            but keep it safe from others to save your quotas/points.</p>

        <h1 id="Songrequest">Songrequest</h1>
        <h2 id="Songrequest-Usage">Usage</h2>
        <p>Are you a broadcaster on twitch? If so, feel free to connect the YouTube player to your twitch chat to enable
            video-requests! Everyone in your chat are able to request a limited amount of videos which is
            configurable. The caster and moderators are able to request any amount of videos.<br><br>Warning, users are
            able to request anything from the YouTube platform!</p>
        <h2 id="Songrequest-Setup">Setup</h2>
        <p>Open up the <a href="../index.html">YouTube player</a> and click "Toggle songrequest". Click "Get TMI" and
            connect with Twitch. Copy the oauth and paste it in the TMI textbox on the player. Keep the TMI secret and
            generate a new one thru "Get TMI" if exposed, people may use the TMI and type in your twitch chat thru YOUR
            ACCOUNT which gives them broadcaster rights! Click "CONNECT" when all fields are filled correctly. Feel free
            to change command thru the command field or the request limit per user thru the request limit field.</p>
        <h2 id="Songrequest-Commands">Commands</h2>
        <p>!yt request VideoURL/VideoId >> Request video (everyone)</p>
        <p>!yt wrong >> Remove your latest request (everyone)</p>
        <p>!yt volume >> Get the YouTube volume (everyone)</p>

        <h1 id="Overlay">Overlay</h1>
        <h2 id="Overlay-Usage">Usage</h2>
        <p>Are you a streamer? If so, feel free to use the overlay functionality to show your viewers what is currently
            playing.</p>
        <h2 id="Overlay-Setup">Setup</h2>
        <p>First of all, open up the <a href="../index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube player</a> and click the button "Toggle overlay". The overlay should pop up
            and you unlock the possibility to change the overlay settings as well as a few settings presets. I would
            personally recommend Preset 1.</p>
